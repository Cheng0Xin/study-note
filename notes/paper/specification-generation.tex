\subsection{1994- Automatic Translation of Natural Language System 
  Specifications into Temporal Logic \cite{nelken1996automatic}}

\textbf{Traditional way to formulate the specification:}
The formulation of specifications often becomes a two stage processes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Specifications are written in natural language (NL).
  \item These specifications are manually translated into temporal logic (TL).
    This is done according to the intuitive understanding of the translator,
    who has to contend with the impression and ambiguity of NL and with subtle 
    interpretation of TL formula.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Discourse Representation Theory (DRT).}
