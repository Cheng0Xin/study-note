\subsection{Gallina Language specifications}

Some useful data types are already defined in \ctextit{Coq.Init.Datatypes}.

\begin{itemize}
  \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\dagger$}
  \item Definition of Enumerated Type,
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=coq]
      Inductive day : Type :=
        | monday : day
        | tuesday : day
        | wednesday : day
        | thursday : day
        | friday : day
        | saturday : day
        | sunday : day.
    \end{lstlisting}
  \item Definition of Function,
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=coq]
      (* Function definition *)
      Definition next_week (d:day) : day :=
        match d with
        | monday => tuesday
        | tuesday => wednesday
        | wednesday => thursday
        | thursday => friday
        | friday => monday
        | saturday => monday
        | sunday => monday
        end.
      
      (* Command to execute the function *)
      Compute (next_week saturday).
    \end{lstlisting}
  \item Theorem and Proofs (\emph{Example} here could be \emph{Theorem}, \emph{Lemma}, etc),
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=coq]
      Example test_next_weekday:
        (next_week (next_week saturday)) = tuesday.
      Proof. 
        simpl. reflexivity.
