\chapter{Logic}

The aim of logic in computer science is to \ctextit{develop languages to model the situations we encounter as computer science professionals}, in such a way that we can \ctextit{reason about them formally}.
The formal proof of the formula $\phi$ is a finite sequence of judgements $(\psi_i)^n_{i=1}$, where each $\psi_i$ is either an \footnote{An axiom A is a judgement evidently claimed to be true.} \ctextbf{axiom} $A_i$, or a formula inferred from the subset $\{\psi_k\}_{k=1}^{i-1}$ of previously derived formulas according the \ctextbf{rules of inference}.
A logical inference is a transfer from one judgement to another, which preserve truth.
In developing logics, we are not concerned with what the sentences really mean, but only in their logical structure.
